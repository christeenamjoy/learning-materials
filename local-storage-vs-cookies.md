Local storage and cookies are both mechanisms used to store data on the client side (i.e., the user's web browser). 
However, there are some key differences between them:

  Size limit: Local storage has a larger storage limit than cookies.
              Local storage typically has a limit of several megabytes,
              while cookies have a limit of a few kilobytes.

  Expiration: Cookies can have an expiration date set, so they can be used for 
              session management or for storing persistent data that needs to be remembered 
              across multiple visits to the same website. Local storage data, on the other hand, 
              persists indefinitely unless it is explicitly cleared by the user or the website.

  Scope: Cookies are sent to the server with every HTTP request, 
         so they can be used to store data that needs to be shared between the client and server. 
         Local storage data, on the other hand, is stored only on the client side and cannot be accessed by the server.

  Security: Cookies can be set to be secure or HTTP-only, 
            which prevents them from being accessed by malicious scripts or 
            from being transmitted over unencrypted connections. Local storage data, 
            on the other hand, is not encrypted by default and can be accessed by any 
            JavaScript running in the same origin.

In general, cookies are more commonly used for session management and for storing small amounts of data
that needs to be shared between the client and server.
Local storage is more commonly used for storing larger amounts of data on the client side,
such as user preferences or application state.
